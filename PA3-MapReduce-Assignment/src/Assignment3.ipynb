    "In this assignment you will need to come up with a MapReduce implementation for several problems (listed below). For each problem, we provide you with a Python script that contains code similar to the above. For each of these scripts you will need to fill in the implmentation of the map function and the reduce function. Your python submission scripts are required to have a mapper function that accepts at least 1 argument and a reducer function that accepts at least 2 arguments. Your submission is also required to have a global variable named mr which points to a MapReduce object. **YOU SHOULD NOT EDIT ANYTHING ELSE IN THE PROGRAM. IF YOU EDIT ANY OTHER PARTS OF ANY OF THE PROVIDED SCRIPTS YOU WILL RECEIVE ZERO POINTS FOR THE CORRESPONDING PROBLEMS.**\n",
